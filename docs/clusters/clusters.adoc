:info_doctype: chapter

This chapter covers creating and configuring EKS clusters using eksctl. It also includes add-ons and EKS Auto Mode.

== Topics: 

* <<access-entries>>
** Simplify Kubernetes RBAC management by replacing aws-auth ConfigMap with EKS access entries
** Migrate existing IAM identity mappings from aws-auth ConfigMap to access entries
** Configure cluster authentication modes and control cluster creator admin permissions
* <<addon-upgrade>>
** Keep clusters secure by updating default EKS add-ons on older clusters
* <<addons>>
** Automate routine tasks for installing, updating, and removing add-ons.
** Amazon EKS Add-ons include AWS add-ons, open source community add-ons, and marketplace add-ons. 
* <<auto-mode>>
** Reduce operational overhead by letting AWS manage your EKS infrastructure
** Configure custom node pools instead of default general-purpose and system pools
** Convert existing EKS clusters to use Auto Mode
* <<cloudwatch-cluster-logging>>
** Troubleshoot cluster issues by enabling logs for specific EKS control plane components
** Configure log retention periods for EKS cluster logs
** Modify existing cluster logging settings using eksctl commands
* <<cluster-upgrade>>
** Maintain security and stability by safely upgrading EKS control plane versions
** Roll out upgrades across nodegroups by replacing old groups with new ones
** Update default cluster add-ons
* <<creating-and-managing-clusters>>
** Start quickly with basic EKS clusters using default managed nodegroups
** Create customized clusters using config files with specific configurations
** Deploy clusters in existing VPCs with private networking and custom IAM policies
* <<customizing-the-kubelet>>
** Prevent node resource starvation by configuring kubelet and system daemon reservations
** Customize eviction thresholds for memory and filesystem availability
** Enable or disable specific kubelet feature gates across node groups
* <<eks-connector>>
** Centralize management of hybrid Kubernetes deployments through EKS Console
** Configure IAM roles and permissions for external cluster access
** Remove external clusters and cleanup associated AWS resources
* <<eks-private-cluster>>
** Meet security requirements with fully-private EKS clusters having no outbound internet access
** Configure private access to AWS services through VPC endpoints
** Create and manage private nodegroups with explicit networking settings
* <<eksctl-karpenter>>
** Automate node provisioning
** Create custom Karpenter provisioner configurations
** Set up Karpenter with spot instance interruption handling
* <<emr-access>>
** Create IAM identity mapping between EMR and EKS cluster
* <<fargate>>
** Define custom Fargate profiles for pod scheduling
** Manage Fargate profiles through creation and configuration updates
* <<unowned-clusters>>
** Standardize management of clusters created outside eksctl
** Use eksctl commands on existing non-eksctl clusters
* <<zonal-shift>>
** Improve application availability by enabling rapid zone failover capabilities
** Configure zonal shift on new EKS cluster deployments
** Enable zonal shift features on existing EKS clusters
