`eksctl` provides some options that can improve the security of your EKS cluster.

== `withOIDC`


Enable https://geoffcline.github.io/eksctl-schema-demo/#iam-withOIDC[`withOIDC`] to automatically create an xref:iamserviceaccounts[IRSA] for the amazon CNI plugin and
limit permissions granted to nodes in your cluster, instead granting the necessary permissions
only to the CNI service account. 

The background is described in link:eks/latest/userguide/cni-iam-role.html["this AWS documentation",type="documentation"].

== `disablePodIMDS`

For managed and unmanaged nodegroups, link:https://geoffcline.github.io/eksctl-schema-demo/#nodeGroups-disablePodIMDS[`disablePodIMDS`] option is available prevents all
non host networking pods running in this nodegroup from making IMDS requests.

[NOTE]

This can not be used together with xref:iam-policies[`withAddonPolicies`].
