# eksctl-docs

Documentation repository for [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl), a simple CLI tool for creating and managing clusters on Amazon EKS.

The primary documentation is authored in AsciiDoc and automatically published to the official AWS documentation site. Schema references are maintained as static web pages for easy browsing and integration.

## Contribute to the Eksctl User Guide on the AWS Docs
